# Shoot-em-up_Game
 Full vertical scrolling shooter workshop.
 
 This is my **second workshop in programming a video game**.

The workshop leads me to realize a simple vertical scrolling shooter game.

Here are the features the workshop helps to put in place:

- View and move a ship
- Make it shoot
- Hover over a map (a level I can change)
- Confronting aliens you are heading towards you
- Destroy the aliens, and the turrets that shoot you!
- Face a final boss!

**Here are the features I have added:**

- Game music background (wink to NeoGeo ViewPoint game)
- Boss music background (wink to NeoGeo ViewPoint game)
- Boss behavior improvement (double and triple shoot according to its energie level, best shifting...)
- Score, energie, newgame management
